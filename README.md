# Final Project
The objective was to practice a number of different strategies from both the attacker, defender, and as a SOC analyst. These tactics include...

Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.

However, all other documentation for Red Team, Blue Team and Network Analysis was my own personal work.***  We were only assigned to be a team to bring our findings together to create a group presentation and present together on the final day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp.
